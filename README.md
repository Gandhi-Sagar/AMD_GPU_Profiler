# AMD_GPU_Profiler
Printing profile information of an AMD GPU.

Platform: Windows (tested on Windows 7, but there is nothing inherently specific to Win7, and it should work seamlessly on modern windows, though not sure if Win32 has changed something in its fundamentals.

- Using Win32 SDK to have a windowing loop and OpenGL on top of it to access the GPU
- If I remember correctly, code must have been adapted from NeHE tutorials

Information gathered from GPU:
GPU Vendor
OpenGL Version
OpenGL Renderer Version
Shading Language Version Support 
Max no of simultaneous o/p buffers 
Max texture size 
Max texture buffer size 
Max texture Units 
Total GPU RAM 

**Use at your own risk, if need something specific, shoot me a PM**
